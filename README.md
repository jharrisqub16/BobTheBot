# BobTheBot
A 360 degrees maze solving detection programmed within Arduino. 

This project was in collaboration with a group partner for an embedded systems assignment. We both programmed and assembled the robot as a team. 

The robot had two tasks:
1. Travel in a complete straight line 
2. Solve a maze
